Hi, I would like some assistance making a weekly schedule for my pumping and breastfeeding. I'm not too sure how often I should be pumping or breastfeeding and I worry that I may not have enough supply to pump. Additionally, I have to go back to work and I don't know how I can maintain consistency when I'm not at home
